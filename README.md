# PythonScraps

Little scraps of code that don't have any other home


### RedditScraperClean.py
I noticed the tone of the subreddit r/DevelEire, an Irish programming forum, changing over 2023/2024 with the squeeze on tech workers/grads. I was curious if the sentiment was mappable, so built a script to scrape recent posts for further analysis.

### tasklist.py
Something I built while learning to read and write from files, I used to have an awful habit of using notepad to jot down tasks but forgetting to save anything outstanding, this solves that problem.
